    <p class="blog">Here is a Story that one of our students shared with us about her Christmas trip to the United
      States.</p>
    <p class="blog"><strong>The Christmas Trip</strong></p>
    <p class="blog">It was Christmas time and Adriana traveled from Mexico to visit her brother and sister-in-law in the
      United States. She hadn’t seen her brother for a few years and was going to finally meet Tina, her brother’s wife.
    </p>
    <p class="blog"><strong>The Arrival</strong></p>
    <p class="blog">When Adriana arrived at the house, her brother presented his wife to her. They spent the next few
      hours chatting and having dinner. Once the desert was finished, they went to the living room and sat around the
      Christmas tree in preparation for the gift exchange.</p>
    <p class="blog"> <strong>The Gift Exchange</strong></p>
    <p class="blog">The presents were opened and the wrapping paper was strewn all about the living room floor. It was
      now Adriana’s turn to give Tina her gift. The present that Adriana chose to give had taken quite a lot of time to
      select because she wanted to be sure that it was something that Tina would really like. She decided to buy a very
      beautiful sweater with stunning colors. She handed the gift to Tina and wished her a merry Christmas. Watching
      Tina’s face with anticipation, she waited for her to open the gift.</p>
