    <p class="blog">The article we are going to look at talks about the attitude with which one must face in a
      negotiation, the spirit in which you have to play to always get the most of the deal. But is this the best
      strategy in the business world? When an authority or a person with certain credentials in the business world
      writes an article, we generally believe what they say without the need for further investigation. In this case, we
      can’t possibly know because it says it was written by the staff of entrepreneur magazine and that its staff is
      made up of 12 people who work in different areas. Who, out of those 12, wrote the article?</p>
    <p class="blog">There are times in which the article is ambiguous but the discussion generates some very interesting
      comments. This is why, in this particular reading exercise, we would like you to not only read the article but
      also direct your attention to the comments as well. At the time of the writing of this post, there are 13 comments
      following the article. The benefit to you is that you will find some very useful colloquial vocabulary which,
      perhaps, may inspire you to participate in some of the discussions and provide some of your own comments. If you
      need assistance or have any doubts, ask your English teacher in class.</p>
    <p class="blog">As with most posts we write, it is recomend that to learn the vocabulary, first, look at the words
      and their meanings, then go to the article by clicking on the link. Finally, come back and review the vocabulary
      again. We hope that by following this tip, your vocabulary and English level will improve.</p>
